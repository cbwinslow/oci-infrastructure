# Security Policy and Compliance Guidelines

## Security Overview

This document outlines the security considerations and compliance requirements for the OCI Infrastructure project. All contributors and users must adhere to these guidelines to maintain the security of the infrastructure.

## Security Principles

### 1. Least Privilege Access
- All IAM policies follow the principle of least privilege
- Access rights are regularly reviewed and adjusted
- Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented
- Service accounts have minimal required permissions

### 2. Network Security
- VCNs are properly segmented
- Security lists and network security groups are strictly controlled
- All unnecessary ports are closed
- Network traffic is monitored and logged

### 3. Data Protection
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Backup systems are encrypted
- Access to sensitive data is logged and audited
- Data retention policies are enforced

### 4. Infrastructure Security
- Regular security patches are applied
- Security groups are properly configured
- Infrastructure is regularly scanned for vulnerabilities
- Security benchmarks are implemented and monitored

## Compliance Requirements

### 1. Access Management
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all accounts
- Regular access reviews are conducted
- Password policies are enforced
- Session management policies are implemented

### 2. Audit and Logging
- All infrastructure changes are logged
- Audit logs are retained according to policy
- Regular audit reviews are conducted
- Automated alerting for suspicious activities

### 3. Incident Response
- Security incident response plan is documented
- Regular incident response drills are conducted
- Incident response team is identified
- Communication protocols are established

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Infrastructure as Code
- All infrastructure changes are version controlled
- Infrastructure code is reviewed for security
- Security policies are implemented as code
- Regular security scanning of IaC

### 2. Secrets Management
- No hardcoded secrets in code
- Secrets are stored in secure vaults
- Secrets rotation is automated
- Access to secrets is logged

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting
- Security events are monitored
- Automated alerts for security incidents
- Regular security reports are generated
- Security metrics are tracked

## Compliance Standards

### 1. Required Standards
- List applicable compliance standards
- Document compliance requirements
- Regular compliance audits
- Compliance reporting procedures

### 2. Security Assessments
- Regular vulnerability assessments
- Penetration testing schedule
- Security control testing
- Compliance verification

## Reporting Security Issues

### 1. Vulnerability Reporting
- Process for reporting security issues
- Security contact information
- Response time expectations
- Issue tracking and resolution

### 2. Security Updates
- Security patch management process
- Emergency update procedures
- Communication protocols
- Verification procedures

## Training and Awareness

### 1. Security Training
- Required security training
- Regular security updates
- Best practices documentation
- Security awareness program

## Compliance Monitoring

### 1. Continuous Monitoring
