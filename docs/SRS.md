# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
# OCI Infrastructure Project

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the software requirements for the OCI Infrastructure project, which provides cloud infrastructure support for the Multi-Agent System Development Framework (MAS Framework).

### 1.2 Scope
The system will provision and manage Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles to support AI agent development and deployment.

### 1.3 Document Conventions
- **SHALL**: Mandatory requirements
- **SHOULD**: Recommended requirements
- **MAY**: Optional requirements

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The OCI Infrastructure project is a component of the larger MAS Framework, providing cloud infrastructure foundation for:

- Development environment provisioning
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Testing environment automation

### 2.2 Product Functions
- Automated OCI resource provisioning via Terraform
- Infrastructure monitoring and logging
- Development environment setup and teardown
- Security and compliance management
- Cost optimization and resource management
