# Agents Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains the AI agent system components for the OCI Infrastructure project. It includes agent definitions, configurations, and deployment specifications for the Multi-Agent System (MAS) Framework.

## Contents

### Planned Structure
```
agents/
├── README.md              # This file
├── agent-definitions/     # Agent type definitions and schemas
├── configurations/        # Agent configuration files
├── deployments/          # Kubernetes deployment manifests
├── monitoring/           # Agent-specific monitoring configurations
└── templates/            # Agent deployment templates
```

## Agent Types
The system will support various types of AI agents:

1. **Development Agents** - Code generation, testing, and development assistance
2. **Infrastructure Agents** - Infrastructure monitoring and management
3. **Orchestration Agents** - Workflow coordination and task distribution
4. **Monitoring Agents** - System health and performance monitoring

## Configuration Guidelines

### Agent Configuration Files
- Use YAML format for configuration files
- Include resource limits and requirements
- Specify inter-agent communication protocols
- Define security and access policies

### Deployment Specifications
- Kubernetes manifests for container orchestration
- Resource allocation and scaling policies
- Service discovery and networking
- Health check and monitoring configurations

## Development Workflow

1. **Define Agent Type** - Create agent definition in `agent-definitions/`
2. **Configure Agent** - Set up configuration in `configurations/`
3. **Create Deployment** - Generate Kubernetes manifests in `deployments/`
4. **Test Locally** - Validate agent functionality
5. **Deploy to Cluster** - Apply to OKE cluster

## Security Considerations

- All agents must implement proper authentication
- Inter-agent communication should be encrypted
- Resource access follows principle of least privilege
- Regular security audits and updates required

## Monitoring and Observability

- Each agent must expose health check endpoints
- Metrics collection for performance monitoring
- Centralized logging for troubleshooting
- Alerting for critical agent failures

## Dependencies

- Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) cluster
- Container registry for agent images
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Service mesh for inter-agent communication

## Getting Started

1. Review agent definitions in `agent-definitions/`
2. Configure agent parameters in `configurations/`
3. Deploy using provided scripts in `../scripts/`
4. Monitor agent status via monitoring dashboards

## Contributing

- Follow established naming conventions
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Add monitoring and alerting configurations
- Update this README with new agent types
