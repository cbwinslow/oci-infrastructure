## Log Management

### Log Formats and Standards

#### Structured Logging
- **JSON Format**: Machine-readable structured logs
- **Common Fields**: timestamp, level, component, message, metadata
- **Correlation IDs**: Track related events across systems
- **Standard Schemas**: Consistent field naming conventions

#### Log Levels
- **ERROR**: Error conditions requiring attention
- **WARN**: Warning conditions that may need investigation
- **INFO**: General informational messages
- **DEBUG**: Detailed debugging information
- **TRACE**: Fine-grained execution traces

### Retention Policies

#### Short-term Retention (30 days)
- Active operational logs
- Debug and trace level logs
- High-frequency monitoring data
- Temporary troubleshooting logs

#### Medium-term Retention (90 days)
- Security audit logs
- Performance baselines
- Deployment history
- System configuration changes

#### Long-term Retention (1+ years)
- Compliance audit trails
- Security incident records
- Business critical events
- Regulatory reporting data

### Log Rotation and Archival

#### Automatic Rotation

- Time-based rotation (daily for high-volume logs)
- Compression of rotated logs
- Automatic cleanup of expired logs

#### Archival Process
- Monthly archival to compressed storage
- Year-based directory organization
- Metadata preservation for archived logs
- Retrieval procedures for archived data

## Security and Access Control

- Digital signatures for critical logs
- Tamper detection mechanisms

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Log Monitoring

- Pattern matching for known issues
- Automated alert generation
- Integration with monitoring systems

### Key Metrics
- Log volume and growth rates
- Error rate trends
- Performance degradation indicators
- Security event frequencies

### Alert Conditions
- Error threshold breaches
- Security event detection
- System health deterioration
- Unusual activity patterns

## Usage Guidelines

### Reading Logs
```bash
# View recent infrastructure logs
tail -f logs/infrastructure.log

# Search for specific events
grep "ERROR" logs/infrastructure.log

# View JSON status files
cat logs/status.json | jq '.'

# Monitor real-time integration status
watch -n 5 cat logs/integration_status.json
```

### Log Analysis
- Use structured query tools for JSON logs
- Implement log correlation for debugging
- Regular pattern analysis for optimization
- Automated report generation

### Best Practices
1. **Include contextual information** in log messages
2. **Use appropriate log levels** for different events
3. **Avoid logging sensitive information** in plain text
4. **Implement log correlation** across components
5. **Regular log review** for operational insights
