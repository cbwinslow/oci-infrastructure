## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
The project includes automated CI/CD integration via `.github/workflows/project-tracking.yml`:

#### Features:
1. **Automatic Labeling** - Issues are automatically labeled based on title patterns
2. **JIRA Synchronization** - Placeholder for JIRA integration (requires API setup)
3. **Monitoring Alerts** - Automated health checks every 4 hours
4. **CI/CD Status Updates** - Terraform validation and status reporting

#### Triggers:
- Issue events (opened, closed, edited, labeled)
- Pull request events
- Push to main/develop branches
- Scheduled monitoring (every 4 hours)

## JIRA Integration

### Setup Requirements
To enable JIRA integration, configure the following:

#### Method 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the interactive setup script
./scripts/setup-jira-integration.sh
```

#### Method 2: Manual Configuration
1. **Edit Environment File**
   ```bash
   # Edit .env.jira file
   nano .env.jira
   
   # Configure your JIRA settings:
   export JIRA_BASE_URL="https://cloudcurio.atlassian.net"
   export JIRA_EMAIL="blaine.winslow@gmail.com"
   export JIRA_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
   export JIRA_PROJECT_KEY="OCIINFRA"
   export GITHUB_REPOSITORY="cbwinslow/oci-infrastructure"
   ```

2. **Test Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Load environment variables
   source .env.jira
   
   # Test connection
   ./scripts/jira-integration.sh test
   
   # Sync existing issues
   ./scripts/jira-integration.sh sync
   ```

2. **Webhook Configuration**
   - GitHub ‚Üí JIRA: Issue creation/updates
   - JIRA ‚Üí GitHub: Status synchronization

3. **Field Mapping**
   - GitHub Labels ‚Üí JIRA Issue Types
   - GitHub Milestones ‚Üí JIRA Epics
   - GitHub Assignees ‚Üí JIRA Assignees

### Integration Features
- **Bidirectional Sync** - Changes in either system reflect in the other
- **Automated Ticket Creation** - GitHub issues automatically create JIRA tickets
- **Status Mapping** - GitHub issue states map to JIRA workflow states
- **Comment Synchronization** - Comments sync between platforms

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Automated Monitoring
The system monitors:
- Log file accumulation
- Uncommitted changes
- Security vulnerabilities
- Infrastructure health
- CI/CD pipeline status

### Alert Types
- **Warning** - Non-critical issues requiring attention
- **Error** - Critical issues requiring immediate action
- **Info** - Status updates and notifications

### Monitoring Schedule
- **Infrastructure Health**: Every 4 hours
- **Security Scans**: Daily
- **Dependency Checks**: Weekly
- **Performance Metrics**: Continuous

## External Tool Integrations

### Planned Integrations
1. **JIRA** - Project management and issue tracking
2. **Slack/Teams** - Notifications and alerts
3. **Monitoring Tools** - Grafana, Prometheus integration
4. **Security Tools** - SAST/DAST integration
5. **Documentation** - Confluence integration

## Usage Guidelines

### Creating Issues
1. Use appropriate templates for different issue types
2. Add relevant labels for automatic categorization
3. Assign to team members when applicable
4. Link to related issues or pull requests

### Project Board Management
1. Move issues through columns based on progress
2. Update labels to reflect current status
3. Use milestones for sprint/release planning
4. Regular grooming and prioritization

### CI/CD Integration
1. All commits trigger validation workflows
2. Issues are automatically updated with CI/CD status
3. Failed builds create notifications
4. Security scans run on schedule

## Metrics and Reporting

### Key Metrics
- Issue resolution time
- Bug discovery rate
- Feature delivery velocity
- Security vulnerability count
- Documentation coverage

### Reports
- Weekly status reports
- Monthly trend analysis
- Quarterly security assessments
- Annual project reviews

## Best Practices
