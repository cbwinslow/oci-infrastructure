# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the software requirements for the OCI Infrastructure Management System.

### 1.2 Scope
The system will provide Infrastructure as Code capabilities for managing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources.
