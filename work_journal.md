## Task 1: Commit Pending Changes

### Time: 17:20:30Z - Starting Git Analysis
**Activity**: Detailed examination of uncommitted changes
**Purpose**: Understand what needs to be organized before committing

**Findings**:
Modified Files (8):
- PROJECT_PLAN.md (root level)
- README.md (root level) 
- SRS.md (root level)
- terraform-oci/terraform-oci/.gitignore
- terraform-oci/terraform-oci/README.md
- terraform-oci/terraform-oci/main.tf
- terraform-oci/terraform-oci/outputs.tf
- terraform-oci/terraform-oci/variables.tf

Untracked Files (discovered):
- agents/ directory with AI integration scripts
- tests/ directory (need to explore)
- scripts/ directory with 20+ automation scripts
- Various security and deployment documentation

**Analysis**: Substantial work completed but not version controlled. Need systematic organization.

### Time: 17:21:15Z - Commit Strategy Planning
**Activity**: Planning commit organization strategy
**Decision**: Group related changes into logical commits rather than one massive commit
**Reasoning**: Better version history, easier rollbacks, clearer change tracking

**Proposed Commit Groups**:
1. Documentation updates (PROJECT_PLAN.md, README.md, SRS.md)
2. Core Terraform configuration changes (main.tf, outputs.tf, variables.tf, .gitignore)
3. AI Agent integration (agents/ directory)
4. Automation scripts (scripts/ directory)
5. Security enhancements and deployment guides
6. Test infrastructure (tests/ directory)
7. Logging and monitoring infrastructure

### Time: 17:22:30Z - Executing Commit Strategy
**Activity**: Implementing planned commit organization

**Commit 1 - Documentation Updates**: 
- Command: `git commit -m "docs: Update project documentation with current status and enhancements"`
- Commit ID: 491d312
- Files: PROJECT_PLAN.md, README.md, SRS.md (75 insertions, 1 deletion)
- **Reasoning**: Documentation provides context for all subsequent changes

**Commit 2 - Core Terraform Configuration**:
- Command: `git commit -m "feat: Enhance core Terraform infrastructure configuration"`  
- Commit ID: 3d8bf21
- Files: main.tf, outputs.tf, variables.tf, .gitignore, terraform README.md
- Stats: 1,117 insertions, 40 deletions across 5 files
