- Change log format defined

**Code Structure Decision**: Used markdown with clear sections for easy navigation and updates

### Time: 17:20:15Z - Journal File Creation  
**Activity**: Created work_journal.md
**Location**: /home/cbwinslow/CBW_SHARED_STORAGE/oci-infrastructure/work_journal.md
**Purpose**: Detailed activity tracking with timestamps and reasoning

**Next Steps**: Begin Task 1 - Commit Pending Changes
**Rationale**: Version control is foundation for all other work

## Task 1: Commit Pending Changes

### Time: 17:20:30Z - Starting Git Analysis
**Activity**: Detailed examination of uncommitted changes
**Purpose**: Understand what needs to be organized before committing

**Findings**:
Modified Files (8):
- PROJECT_PLAN.md (root level)
- README.md (root level) 
- SRS.md (root level)
- terraform-oci/terraform-oci/.gitignore
- terraform-oci/terraform-oci/README.md
- terraform-oci/terraform-oci/main.tf
- terraform-oci/terraform-oci/outputs.tf
- terraform-oci/terraform-oci/variables.tf

Untracked Files (discovered):
- agents/ directory with AI integration scripts
- tests/ directory (need to explore)
- scripts/ directory with 20+ automation scripts
- Various security and deployment documentation

**Analysis**: Substantial work completed but not version controlled. Need systematic organization.

### Time: 17:21:15Z - Commit Strategy Planning
**Activity**: Planning commit organization strategy
**Decision**: Group related changes into logical commits rather than one massive commit
**Reasoning**: Better version history, easier rollbacks, clearer change tracking

**Proposed Commit Groups**:
1. Documentation updates (PROJECT_PLAN.md, README.md, SRS.md)
2. Core Terraform configuration changes (main.tf, outputs.tf, variables.tf, .gitignore)
3. AI Agent integration (agents/ directory)
4. Automation scripts (scripts/ directory)
5. Security enhancements and deployment guides
6. Test infrastructure (tests/ directory)
7. Logging and monitoring infrastructure

### Time: 17:22:30Z - Executing Commit Strategy
**Activity**: Implementing planned commit organization

**Achievement**: Successfully organized and committed all pending changes
**Statistics**: 
- Total commits: 8
- Total insertions: 8,465
- Total deletions: 41 
- Files affected: 37

**Decision**: Proceed to Task 2 - Terraform validation
**Reasoning**: Clean version control foundation established, ready for validation phase

## Task 2: Validate Terraform Configurations

### Time: 17:36:15Z - Starting Terraform Validation
**Activity**: Beginning comprehensive Terraform validation process
**Location**: /home/cbwinslow/CBW_SHARED_STORAGE/oci-infrastructure/terraform-oci/terraform-oci
**Purpose**: Ensure all Terraform configurations are syntactically correct and properly formatted

**Validation Plan**:
1. Terraform format check (terraform fmt)
2. Terraform validation (terraform validate) 
3. Terraform initialization check (terraform init)
4. Terraform plan generation (dry run)
5. Security validation using external tools if available

### Time: 17:37:30Z - Terraform Format Check Results
**Activity**: Running `terraform fmt -check`
**Status**: ‚ùå FAILED - Syntax errors discovered

**Issues Found**: Invalid escape sequences in variables.tf
- Line 15: tenancy_ocid regex pattern has incorrect escaping
- Line 25: user_ocid regex pattern has incorrect escaping  
- Line 55: compartment_id regex pattern has incorrect escaping

**Problem**: Regex patterns using `\.` need proper escaping for Terraform
**Solution**: Fix regex patterns by properly escaping backslashes

**Decision**: Fix syntax errors before proceeding with validation
**Reasoning**: Cannot proceed with terraform validate until syntax is correct
