# Security Enhancements for OCI Infrastructure

## Overview

This document outlines the security improvements implemented in the OCI Terraform infrastructure configuration. These enhancements provide better access control, resource management, and security monitoring capabilities.

## 1. Network Security Groups (NSGs)

### SSH Security Group
- **Purpose**: Controls SSH access to compute instances
- **Key Features**:
  - Restricts SSH access (port 22) based on configurable CIDR blocks
  - Uses variable `allowed_ssh_cidr` for flexible IP range configuration
  - **IMPORTANT**: Default allows all IPs (0.0.0.0/0) - must be restricted for production

### Web Security Group
- **Purpose**: Controls HTTP/HTTPS access to web applications
- **Ports Allowed**:
  - Port 80 (HTTP)
  - Port 443 (HTTPS)
- **Source**: Currently allows access from all IPs for web traffic

### Database Security Group
- **Purpose**: Controls database access between application and database tiers
- **Configuration**: Allows access from instance subnet to database ports

## 2. Enhanced Resource Tagging

All resources now include standardized tags for better management:

```hcl
freeform_tags = {
  "environment" = "development"
  "managed-by"  = "terraform"
  "owner"       = "infrastructure-team"
}
```

### Tagged Resources:
- Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)
- Internet Gateway
- Route Tables
- Security Lists
- Network Security Groups
- Compute Instances
- Block Volumes
- Subnets

## 3. Security Configuration Variables

### New Variable: `allowed_ssh_cidr`
- **Purpose**: Control SSH access by IP range
- **Default**: `0.0.0.0/0` (allows all - change for production)
- **Validation**: Ensures valid CIDR format
- **Usage**: Set to specific IP ranges or VPN subnets in production

## 4. Security Best Practices Implemented

### Network Segmentation
- Separate security groups for different access types
- Instance-level network security group assignment
- Subnet-based access controls

### Access Control
- SSH access configurable by IP range
- Database access restricted to application subnet
- Web traffic separated from administrative access

### Resource Management
- Comprehensive tagging for cost allocation
- Environment identification for governance
- Ownership tracking for responsibility

## 5. Security Recommendations for Production

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Restrict SSH Access**: 
   ```hcl
   allowed_ssh_cidr = "YOUR_OFFICE_IP/32"  # or VPN subnet
   ```

2. **Enable Additional Monitoring**:
   - Configure OCI Cloud Guard
   - Enable VCN Flow Logs
   - Set up security notifications

3. **Implement Additional Security Groups**:
   - Database-specific access rules
   - Application-tier communications
   - Load balancer restrictions

### Advanced Security Enhancements:
1. **Private Subnets**: Move databases to private subnets
2. **Bastion Hosts**: Implement jump servers for administrative access
3. **WAF Integration**: Add Web Application Firewall for web traffic
4. **Key Management**: Use OCI Key Management Service (KMS)

## 6. Validation Steps

Before applying the Terraform plan:

1. **Review SSH Access**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan -var="allowed_ssh_cidr=YOUR_IP/32"
   ```

2. **Verify Security Groups**:
   - Check NSG rules match security requirements
   - Validate port access aligns with application needs

3. **Confirm Resource Tags**:
   - Ensure all resources will have proper tags
   - Verify tag values match organizational standards

## 7. Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Security Reviews:
- Monthly review of NSG rules
- Quarterly access audit
- Annual security assessment

### Automated Monitoring:
- Set up alerts for security group changes
- Monitor unusual access patterns
- Track resource tag compliance

## 8. Emergency Procedures

### Quick SSH Access Restriction:
```bash
terraform apply -var="allowed_ssh_cidr=TRUSTED_IP/32"
```

### Disable Public Access:
```bash
# Remove public IP assignment
terraform apply -var="assign_public_ip=false"
```

## Next Steps

1. Review and customize the `allowed_ssh_cidr` variable
2. Apply the enhanced security configuration
3. Verify connectivity and access controls
4. Document any additional security requirements
5. Set up monitoring and alerting

**Note**: These security enhancements follow OCI security best practices and Terraform Infrastructure as Code principles. Regular review and updates are recommended to maintain security posture.
